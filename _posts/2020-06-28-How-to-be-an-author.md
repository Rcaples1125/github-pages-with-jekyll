If you are like me and have a creative mind, your thoughts running through your head 
must be driving you crazy. Have you ever thought that maybe you need to release them?
You may have a person on your mind that you like or you maybe you don'yt like them and
you go through senareos that you could imagine just to torture them. I am here to tell you
that you aren't alone. I think it's time to open your creative mind and put those thoughts on paper.
